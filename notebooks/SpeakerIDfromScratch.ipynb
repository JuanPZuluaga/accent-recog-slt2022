    "# **Speech Classification From Scratch**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to figure out how to implement a **classification** system with SpeechBrain? Look no further, you're in the right place. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps needed to implement an **utterance-level classifier** in SpeechBrain.  \n",
    "The tutorial will initially focus on **speaker identification** and will describe, along the way, how to extend it to many other classification tasks such as **language-id**, **emotion recognition**, **sound classification**, **keyword spotting**, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Models**\n",
    "Many neural models can be used to approach this kind of task. In this tutorial, we will focus on a **TDNN** classifier (*xvector*) and a very recent model called [**ECAPA-TDNN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143) that showed impressive performance in speaker verification and diarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data**\n",
    "Training will be done with a small open-source dataset called [mini-librispeech](https://www.openslr.org/31/), which only contains few hours of training data. In a real case, you need a much larger dataset.\n",
    "For some examples on a real task, please [take a look into our Voxceleb recipes](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/VoxCeleb/SpeakerRec).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Code**\n",

    "## **Which steps are needed?**\n",
    "Training an utterance-level classifier is relatively easy in SpeechBrain. The steps to follows are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare your data**.\n",
    "The goal of this step is to create the data manifest files (in CSV or JSON format). The data manifest files tell SpeechBrain where to find the speech data and their corresponding utterance-level classification (e.g., speaker id). In this tutorial, the data manifest files are created by [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speaker_id/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train the classifier**.\n",
    "At this point, we are ready to train our classifier. \n",
    "To train  a speaker-id classifier based on TDNN + statistical pooling (xvectors), run the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd speechbrain/templates/speaker_id/\n",
    "python train.py train.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "Later, we will describe how to plug another model called Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation, and Aggregation model (ECAPA) that turned out to provide impressive performance in speaker recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use the classifier (inference)**:\n",
    "After training, we can use the classifier for inference. A class called `EncoderClassifier` is designed to make inference easier. We also designed a class called `SpeakerRecognition` to make inference on a speaker verification task easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now provide a detailed description of all these steps."

    "The goal of data preparation is to create the data manifest files. \n",
    "These files tell SpeechBrain where to find the audio data and their corresponding utterance-level classification. They are text files written in the popular CSV and JSON formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data manifest files**\n",
    "Let's take a look into how a data manifest file in JSON format looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"163-122947-0045\": {\n",
    "    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/163/122947/163-122947-0045.flac\",\n",
    "    \"length\": 14.335,\n",
    "    \"spk_id\": \"163\"\n",

    "    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/7312/92432/7312-92432-0025.flac\",\n",
    "    \"length\": 12.01,\n",
    "    \"spk_id\": \"7312\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"7859-102519-0036\": {\n",
    "    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/7859/102519/7859-102519-0036.flac\",\n",
    "    \"length\": 11.965,\n",
    "    \"spk_id\": \"7859\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, we have a hierarchical structure in which the first key is a **unique identifier** of the spoken sentence. \n",
    "Then, we specify all the fields that are needed for the task addressed. For instance, we report the **path of the speech recording**, its **length** in seconds (needed if we wanna sort the sentences before creating the mini-batches), and the **speaker identity** of the speaker in the given recording. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you can specify here all entries that you need (language-id, emotion annotation, etc). However, there must be a matching between the name of these entries and what the experiment script (e.g, train.py) expects. We will elaborate more on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we define a special variable called `data_root`. This allows users to dynamically change the data folder from the command line (or from the yaml hyperparameter file).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preparation Script**\n",
    "**Every dataset is formatted in a different way**. The script that parses your own dataset and creates the JSON or the CSV files is something that you are supposed to write. Most of the time, this is very straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the mini-librispeech dataset, for instance, we wrote this simple data preparation script called [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speaker_id/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "This function automatically downloads the data (that in this case are publicly available). We search for all the audio files and while reading them we create the JSON file with the speaker-id annotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this script as a good base for your **custom preparation** on your target dataset. As you can see, we create three separate data manifest files to manage training, validation, and test phases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Copy your data locally**\n",
    "When using speechbrain (or any other toolkit) within an HPC cluster, a good practice is to compress your dataset in a single file and **copy (and uncompress) the data in the local folder of the computing node**. This would make the code much **much faster** because the data aren't fetched from the shared filesystem but from the local one. Moreover, you don't harm the performance of the shared filesystem with tons of reading operations. We **strongly suggest users follow this approach** (not possible here in Google Colab)."

    "#### **Change train.py**\n",
    "The only thing to remember is that the name entries in the JSON file must match with what the dataloader expectes in `train.py`.  For instance, if you defined an emotion key in JSON, you should have it in the dataio pipeline of `train.py` something like this:\n",

    "### **Train with your own model**\n",
    "At some point, you might have your own model and you would like to plug it into the speech recognition pipeline. \n",
    "For instance, you might wanna replace our xvector encoder with something different. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, you have to create your own class and specify there the list of computations for your neural network. You can take a look into the models already existing in [speechbrain.lobes.models](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models). If your model is a plain pipeline of computations, you can use the [sequential container](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/CRDNN.py#L14). If the model is a more complex chain of computations, you can create it as an instance of `torch.nn.Module` and define there the `__init__` and `forward` methods like [here](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/Xvector.py#L18).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you defined your model, you only have to declare it in the yaml file and use it in `train.py`\n",

    "**Important:**  \n",
    "When plugging a new model, you have to tune again the most important hyperparameters of the system (e.g, learning rate, batch size, and the architectural parameters) to make it working well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ECAPA-TDNN model**\n",
    "One model that we find particularly effective for speaker recognition is the ECAPA-TDNN one [implemented here](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/ECAPA_TDNN.py).\n",

    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure, the ECAPA-TDNN architecture is based on the popular x-vector topology and it introduces **several enhancements** to create more robust speaker embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layer uses a **channel- and context-dependent attention** mechanism, which allows the network to attend different frames per channel. \n",
    "1-dimensional **SqueezeExcitation** (SE)  blocks rescale the channels of the intermediate frame-level feature maps to insert **global context** information in the locally operating convolutional blocks. \n",
    "Next, the integration of 1-dimensional **Res2-blocks** improves performance while simultaneously reducing the total parameter count\n",
    "by using grouped convolutions in a hierarchical way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **Multi-layer Feature Aggregation (MFA)** merges complementary information before the statistics pooling by concatenating the final frame-level feature map with an intermediate feature\n",
    "maps of preceding layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by optimizing the **AAMsoftmax** loss on the speaker identities in the training corpus. The AAM-softmax is a powerful enhancement compared to the regular softmax loss in the context of fine-grained classification and verification problems. It directly optimizes the\n",
    "cosine distance between the speaker embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model turned out to work amazingly well for [speaker verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143) and [speaker diarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01466). We found it very effective in other utterance-level classification tasks such as language-id, emotion recognition, and keyword spotting.\n",
